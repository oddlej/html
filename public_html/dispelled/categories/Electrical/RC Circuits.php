<h1>RC Circuits</h1>
<p>RC circuits are circuits that contain both resistors (R) and capacitors (C). They are used in various applications, such as filtering, timing, and signal processing.</p>

<h2>Types of RC Circuits</h2>
<p>There are two main types of RC circuits:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Series RC Circuit</strong>: The resistor and capacitor are connected in series.</li>
    <li><strong>Parallel RC Circuit</strong>: The resistor and capacitor are connected in parallel.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Time Constant</h2>
<p>The time constant (τ) of an RC circuit is a measure of how quickly the circuit responds to changes in voltage. It is given by:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
τ = R * C
</code>
</pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>τ</strong> is the time constant (in seconds)</li>
    <li><strong>R</strong> is the resistance (in ohms)</li>
    <li><strong>C</strong> is the capacitance (in farads)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Charging and Discharging</h2>
<p>The voltage across the capacitor in an RC circuit changes over time as the capacitor charges or discharges. The equations for charging and discharging are:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
Charging: V(t) = V0 * (1 - e^(-t/τ))
Discharging: V(t) = V0 * e^(-t/τ)
</code>
</pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>V(t)</strong> is the voltage across the capacitor at time t</li>
    <li><strong>V0</strong> is the initial voltage</li>
    <li><strong>t</strong> is the time</li>
    <li><strong>τ</strong> is the time constant</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applications of RC Circuits</h2>
<p>RC circuits are used in various applications, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Filtering: Removing unwanted frequencies from signals.</li>
    <li>Timing: Creating time delays in circuits.</li>
    <li>Signal Processing: Shaping and conditioning signals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example Circuit</h2>
<p>Here is an example of a simple low-pass filter using an RC circuit:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
Components:
- Resistor (1k ohm)
- Capacitor (100uF)
- Power supply (5V)

Circuit:
1. Connect the resistor and capacitor in series.
2. Connect the series combination to the power supply (5V).
3. Measure the voltage across the capacitor.

The cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter is given by:
f_c = 1 / (2 * π * R * C)
