<h1>Filters</h1>
<p>Filters are electronic circuits that remove unwanted frequencies from signals. They are used in various applications, such as signal processing, communication systems, and audio electronics.</p>

<h2>Types of Filters</h2>
<p>There are several types of filters, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Low-Pass Filters</strong>: Allow low frequencies to pass and attenuate high frequencies.</li>
    <li><strong>High-Pass Filters</strong>: Allow high frequencies to pass and attenuate low frequencies.</li>
    <li><strong>Band-Pass Filters</strong>: Allow a specific range of frequencies to pass and attenuate frequencies outside this range.</li>
    <li><strong>Band-Stop Filters</strong>: Attenuate a specific range of frequencies and allow frequencies outside this range to pass.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Filter Design</h2>
<p>Filters can be designed using various components, such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors. The design equations for different types of filters are:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
Low-Pass Filter: f_c = 1 / (2πRC)
High-Pass Filter: f_c = 1 / (2πRC)
Band-Pass Filter: f_c = 1 / (2π√(LC))
Band-Stop Filter: f_c = 1 / (2π√(LC))
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Applications of Filters</h2>
<p>Filters are used in various applications, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Signal Processing: Removing unwanted frequencies from signals.</li>
    <li>Communication Systems: Filtering out noise and interference.</li>
    <li>Audio Electronics: Shaping the frequency response of audio signals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example Circuit</h2>
<p>Here is an example of a simple low-pass filter circuit:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
Components:
- Resistor (1k ohm)
- Capacitor (100uF)
- Power supply (5V)

Circuit:
1. Connect the resistor and capacitor in series.
2. Connect the series combination to the power supply (5V).
3. Measure the voltage across the capacitor.

The cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter is given by:
f_c = 1 / (2πRC)
