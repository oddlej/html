<h1>RLC Circuits</h1>
<p>RLC circuits are electrical circuits that contain resistors (R), inductors (L), and capacitors (C). They are used in various applications, such as filtering, tuning, and signal processing.</p>

<h2>Types of RLC Circuits</h2>
<p>There are two main types of RLC circuits:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Series RLC Circuit</strong>: The resistor, inductor, and capacitor are connected in series.</li>
    <li><strong>Parallel RLC Circuit</strong>: The resistor, inductor, and capacitor are connected in parallel.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Resonance</h2>
<p>RLC circuits exhibit resonance, which occurs when the inductive reactance (XL) and capacitive reactance (XC) are equal. The resonant frequency (fr) is given by:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
fr = 1 / (2π√(LC))
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Impedance</h2>
<p>The impedance (Z) of an RLC circuit is given by:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
Series RLC: Z = R + j(XL - XC)
Parallel RLC: 1/Z = 1/R + 1/jXL + 1/jXC
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Applications of RLC Circuits</h2>
<p>RLC circuits are used in various applications, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Filtering: Removing unwanted frequencies from signals.</li>
    <li>Tuning: Selecting specific frequencies in radio receivers.</li>
    <li>Signal Processing: Shaping and conditioning signals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example Circuit</h2>
<p>Here is an example of a simple series RLC circuit:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
Components:
- Resistor (1k ohm)
- Inductor (100uH)
- Capacitor (100uF)
- Power supply (5V AC, 60Hz)

Circuit:
1. Connect the resistor, inductor, and capacitor in series.
2. Connect the series combination to the AC power supply.

The impedance of the circuit is given by:
Z = R + j(XL - XC)
