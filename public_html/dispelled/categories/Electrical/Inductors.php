<h1>Inductors</h1>
<p>Inductors are passive electronic components that store energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through them. They are used in various applications, such as filtering, energy storage, and signal processing.</p>

<h2>Types of Inductors</h2>
<p>There are several types of inductors, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Air Core Inductors</strong>: Have no magnetic core, used for high-frequency applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Iron Core Inductors</strong>: Have an iron core, used for low-frequency applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Ferrite Core Inductors</strong>: Have a ferrite core, used for medium-frequency applications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Inductance</h2>
<p>The inductance of an inductor is measured in henries (H) and is defined as the amount of magnetic flux generated per unit current. The formula for inductance is:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
L = (N^2 * μ * A) / l
</code>
</pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>L</strong> is the inductance (in henries)</li>
    <li><strong>N</strong> is the number of turns</li>
    <li><strong>μ</strong> is the permeability of the core material</li>
    <li><strong>A</strong> is the cross-sectional area of the core</li>
    <li><strong>l</strong> is the length of the core</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applications of Inductors</h2>
<p>Inductors are used in various applications, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Filtering: Removing unwanted frequencies from signals.</li>
    <li>Energy Storage: Storing energy in power supplies.</li>
    <li>Transformers: Transferring energy between circuits.</li>
    <li>Oscillators: Generating periodic signals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example Circuit</h2>
<p>Here is an example of a simple LC (inductor-capacitor) circuit:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
Components:
- Inductor (100uH)
- Capacitor (100uF)
- Power supply (5V)

Circuit:
1. Connect the inductor and capacitor in series.
2. Connect the series combination to the power supply (5V).

When the power supply is connected, the inductor and capacitor will form an oscillating circuit, generating a periodic signal.
