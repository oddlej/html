<h1>Diodes</h1>
<p>Diodes are semiconductor devices that allow current to flow in one direction only. They are used in various applications, such as rectification, signal modulation, and voltage regulation.</p>

<h2>Types of Diodes</h2>
<p>There are several types of diodes, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Rectifier Diodes</strong>: Used for converting AC to DC.</li>
    <li><strong>Zener Diodes</strong>: Used for voltage regulation.</li>
    <li><strong>Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs)</strong>: Emit light when current flows through them.</li>
    <li><strong>Schottky Diodes</strong>: Have low forward voltage drop, used for high-speed switching.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Diode Characteristics</h2>
<p>Diodes have a characteristic called the forward voltage drop, which is the voltage required for the diode to conduct current. For silicon diodes, this is typically around 0.7V, and for Schottky diodes, it is around 0.2V.</p>

<h2>Applications of Diodes</h2>
<p>Diodes are used in various applications, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rectification: Converting AC to DC.</li>
    <li>Voltage Regulation: Maintaining a constant voltage.</li>
    <li>Signal Modulation: Modulating signals in communication systems.</li>
    <li>Protection: Protecting circuits from voltage spikes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example Circuit</h2>
<p>Here is an example of a simple rectifier circuit using a diode:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
Components:
- Diode (1N4007)
- Resistor (1k ohm)
- Power supply (5V AC)

Circuit:
1. Connect the anode of the diode to the positive terminal of the power supply.
2. Connect the cathode of the diode to one end of the resistor.
3. Connect the other end of the resistor to the negative terminal of the power supply.

When the power supply is connected, the diode will allow current to flow in one direction, converting the AC voltage to DC.
