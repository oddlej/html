<h1>Operational Amplifiers</h1>
<p>Operational amplifiers (op-amps) are integrated circuits used to amplify voltage signals. They are widely used in analog electronics for various applications, such as signal conditioning, filtering, and mathematical operations.</p>

<h2>Op-Amp Characteristics</h2>
<p>Op-amps have several key characteristics, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>High Gain</strong>: Op-amps have a high open-loop gain, typically around 100,000 or more.</li>
    <li><strong>High Input Impedance</strong>: Op-amps have a high input impedance, which means they draw very little current from the input source.</li>
    <li><strong>Low Output Impedance</strong>: Op-amps have a low output impedance, which allows them to drive low-impedance loads.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Op-Amp Configurations</h2>
<p>Op-amps can be configured in various ways, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Inverting Amplifier</strong>: Inverts and amplifies the input signal.</li>
    <li><strong>Non-Inverting Amplifier</strong>: Amplifies the input signal without inverting it.</li>
    <li><strong>Voltage Follower</strong>: Provides unity gain and high input impedance.</li>
    <li><strong>Summing Amplifier</strong>: Sums multiple input signals.</li>
    <li><strong>Differential Amplifier</strong>: Amplifies the difference between two input signals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applications of Op-Amps</h2>
<p>Op-amps are used in various applications, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Signal Conditioning: Amplifying and filtering signals.</li>
    <li>Mathematical Operations: Performing addition, subtraction, integration, and differentiation.</li>
    <li>Oscillators: Generating periodic signals.</li>
    <li>Voltage Regulation: Maintaining a constant voltage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example Circuit</h2>
<p>Here is an example of a simple inverting amplifier circuit using an op-amp:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
Components:
- Op-amp (e.g., LM741)
- Resistor R1 (10k ohm)
- Resistor R2 (100k ohm)
- Power supply (±15V)

Circuit:
1. Connect the non-inverting input (+) of the op-amp to ground.
2. Connect the inverting input (-) of the op-amp to one end of R1.
3. Connect the other end of R1 to the input signal.
4. Connect R2 between the inverting input (-) and the output of the op-amp.
5. Connect the power supply to the op-amp (±15V).

The gain of the inverting amplifier is given by:
Gain = -R2 / R1
