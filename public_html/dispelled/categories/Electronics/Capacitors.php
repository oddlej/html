<h1>Capacitors</h1>
<p>Capacitors are passive electronic components that store and release electrical energy. They are widely used in electronic circuits for various purposes, such as filtering, coupling, and energy storage.</p>

<h2>Types of Capacitors</h2>
<p>There are several types of capacitors, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ceramic Capacitors</strong>: Made of ceramic material, commonly used for high-frequency applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Electrolytic Capacitors</strong>: Made of aluminum or tantalum, used for high-capacitance applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Film Capacitors</strong>: Made of plastic film, used for precision applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Supercapacitors</strong>: High-capacitance capacitors used for energy storage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Capacitance</h2>
<p>The capacitance of a capacitor is measured in farads (F) and is defined as the amount of electric charge stored per unit voltage. The formula for capacitance is:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
C = Q / V
</code>
</pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>C</strong> is the capacitance (in farads)</li>
    <li><strong>Q</strong> is the electric charge (in coulombs)</li>
    <li><strong>V</strong> is the voltage (in volts)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Charging and Discharging</h2>
<p>When a voltage is applied across the terminals of a capacitor, it charges up to the applied voltage. When the voltage is removed, the capacitor discharges its stored energy. The charging and discharging behavior of a capacitor is described by the following equations:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
Charging: V(t) = V0 * (1 - e^(-t/RC))
Discharging: V(t) = V0 * e^(-t/RC)
</code>
</pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>V(t)</strong> is the voltage across the capacitor at time t</li>
    <li><strong>V0</strong> is the initial voltage</li>
    <li><strong>R</strong> is the resistance in the circuit</li>
    <li><strong>C</strong> is the capacitance</li>
    <li><strong>t</strong> is the time</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applications of Capacitors</h2>
<p>Capacitors are used in various applications, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Filtering: Removing unwanted frequencies from signals.</li>
    <li>Coupling: Allowing AC signals to pass while blocking DC signals.</li>
    <li>Decoupling: Reducing noise in power supply lines.</li>
    <li>Energy Storage: Storing energy for later use.</li>
    <li>Tuning: Adjusting the frequency response of circuits.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example Circuit</h2>
<p>Here is an example of a simple RC (resistor-capacitor) circuit:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
Components:
- Resistor (1k ohm)
- Capacitor (100uF)
- Power supply (5V)

Circuit:
1. Connect the resistor and capacitor in series.
2. Connect the series combination to the power supply (5V).

When the power supply is connected, the capacitor will charge through the resistor. When the power supply is disconnected, the capacitor will discharge through the resistor.
