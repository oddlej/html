<h1>AC Circuits</h1>
<p>AC (Alternating Current) circuits are electrical circuits powered by an alternating voltage source. In AC circuits, the current and voltage vary sinusoidally with time.</p>

<h2>AC Waveforms</h2>
<p>The most common AC waveform is the sinusoidal waveform, which can be described by the following equation:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
V(t) = Vmax * sin(ωt + φ)
</code>
</pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>V(t)</strong> is the instantaneous voltage at time t</li>
    <li><strong>Vmax</strong> is the peak voltage</li>
    <li><strong>ω</strong> is the angular frequency (ω = 2πf)</li>
    <li><strong>t</strong> is the time</li>
    <li><strong>φ</strong> is the phase angle</li>
</ul>

<h2>Impedance</h2>
<p>In AC circuits, impedance (Z) is the total opposition to the flow of current and is a combination of resistance (R) and reactance (X). The impedance is given by:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
Z = R + jX
</code>
</pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Z</strong> is the impedance (in ohms)</li>
    <li><strong>R</strong> is the resistance (in ohms)</li>
    <li><strong>X</strong> is the reactance (in ohms)</li>
    <li><strong>j</strong> is the imaginary unit</li>
</ul>

<h2>Power in AC Circuits</h2>
<p>The power in AC circuits can be divided into three types:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Real Power (P)</strong>: The actual power consumed by the circuit, measured in watts (W).</li>
    <li><strong>Reactive Power (Q)</strong>: The power stored and released by the reactive components, measured in volt-amperes reactive (VAR).</li>
    <li><strong>Apparent Power (S)</strong>: The total power supplied to the circuit, measured in volt-amperes (VA).</li>
</ul>
<p>The relationship between these powers is given by:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
S^2 = P^2 + Q^2
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Applications of AC Circuits</h2>
<p>AC circuits are used in various applications, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Power Distribution: Supplying electrical power to homes and industries.</li>
    <li>Signal Processing: Amplifying and filtering signals.</li>
    <li>Communication Systems: Transmitting and receiving signals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example Circuit</h2>
<p>Here is an example of a simple AC circuit with a resistor and capacitor in series:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
Components:
- Resistor (1k ohm)
- Capacitor (100uF)
- AC power supply (10V, 60Hz)

Circuit:
1. Connect the resistor and capacitor in series.
2. Connect the series combination to the AC power supply.

The impedance of the circuit is given by:
Z = R + 1/(jωC)
