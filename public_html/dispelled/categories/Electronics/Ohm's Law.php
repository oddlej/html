<h1>Ohm's Law</h1>
<p>Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in electrical engineering that describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electrical circuit. It is essential for understanding how electrical circuits operate.</p>

<h2>Ohm's Law Formula</h2>
<p>The formula for Ohm's Law is:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
V = I * R
</code>
</pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>V</strong> is the voltage (in volts)</li>
    <li><strong>I</strong> is the current (in amperes)</li>
    <li><strong>R</strong> is the resistance (in ohms)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Understanding Ohm's Law</h2>
<p>Ohm's Law states that the current flowing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance between them. This means that if you increase the voltage, the current will increase, provided the resistance remains constant. Conversely, if you increase the resistance, the current will decrease, provided the voltage remains constant.</p>

<h2>Example Calculation</h2>
<p>Let's consider an example to illustrate Ohm's Law:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
Suppose you have a circuit with a voltage of 12 volts and a resistance of 4 ohms. To find the current flowing through the circuit, you can use Ohm's Law:

V = I * R

Rearrange the formula to solve for I (current):

I = V / R

Substitute the given values:

I = 12V / 4Î©
I = 3A

So, the current flowing through the circuit is 3 amperes.

<h2>Applications of Ohm's Law</h2>
<p>Ohm's Law is used in various applications, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Designing electrical circuits</li>
    <li>Calculating the required resistance for a specific current and voltage</li>
    <li>Troubleshooting electrical problems</li>
    <li>Understanding the behavior of electrical components</li>
</ul>

<h2>Practice Problems</h2>
<p>Here are some practice problems to help you understand Ohm's Law better:</p>
<ol>
    <li>A circuit has a voltage of 24 volts and a resistance of 8 ohms. What is the current flowing through the circuit?</li>
    <li>If the current flowing through a circuit is 5 amperes and the resistance is 10 ohms, what is the voltage across the circuit?</li>
    <li>A circuit has a voltage of 9 volts and a current of 2 amperes. What is the resistance of the circuit?</li>
</ol>
