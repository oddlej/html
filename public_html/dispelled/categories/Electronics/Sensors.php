<h1>Sensors</h1>
<p>Sensors are devices that detect and measure physical quantities, such as temperature, pressure, light, and motion, and convert them into electrical signals. They are used in various applications, such as automation, robotics, and environmental monitoring.</p>

<h2>Types of Sensors</h2>
<p>There are several types of sensors, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Temperature Sensors</strong>: Measure temperature (e.g., thermocouples, thermistors).</li>
    <li><strong>Pressure Sensors</strong>: Measure pressure (e.g., piezoelectric sensors, strain gauges).</li>
    <li><strong>Light Sensors</strong>: Measure light intensity (e.g., photodiodes, phototransistors).</li>
    <li><strong>Motion Sensors</strong>: Detect motion (e.g., accelerometers, gyroscopes).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sensor Characteristics</h2>
<p>Sensors have several key characteristics, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sensitivity</strong>: The change in output signal per unit change in the measured quantity.</li>
    <li><strong>Range</strong>: The range of values that the sensor can measure.</li>
    <li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: The degree to which the measured value matches the true value.</li>
    <li><strong>Response Time</strong>: The time taken by the sensor to respond to a change in the measured quantity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applications of Sensors</h2>
<p>Sensors are used in various applications, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Automation: Monitoring and controlling industrial processes.</li>
    <li>Robotics: Providing feedback for robot control systems.</li>
    <li>Environmental Monitoring: Measuring environmental parameters, such as temperature and humidity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example Circuit</h2>
<p>Here is an example of a simple temperature sensor circuit using a thermistor:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
Components:
- Thermistor (NTC)
- Resistor (10k ohms)
- Power supply (5V)
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino)

Circuit:
1. Connect the thermistor and resistor in series.
2. Connect the series combination to the 5V power supply.
3. Connect the junction of the thermistor and resistor to an analog input pin of the microcontroller.

The microcontroller can measure the voltage at the junction and calculate the temperature based on the thermistor's resistance.
