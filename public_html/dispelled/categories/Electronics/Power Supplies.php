<h1>Power Supplies</h1>
<p>Power supplies are devices that provide electrical power to electronic circuits and devices. They convert electrical energy from one form to another and regulate the output voltage and current.</p>

<h2>Types of Power Supplies</h2>
<p>There are several types of power supplies, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Linear Power Supplies</strong>: Use linear regulators to provide a stable output voltage.</li>
    <li><strong>Switching Power Supplies</strong>: Use switching regulators to provide a stable output voltage with higher efficiency.</li>
    <li><strong>Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS)</strong>: Provide backup power during power outages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Power Supply Characteristics</h2>
<p>Power supplies have several key characteristics, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Output Voltage</strong>: The voltage provided by the power supply.</li>
    <li><strong>Output Current</strong>: The current provided by the power supply.</li>
    <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: The ratio of output power to input power.</li>
    <li><strong>Regulation</strong>: The ability to maintain a constant output voltage despite changes in input voltage or load.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applications of Power Supplies</h2>
<p>Power supplies are used in various applications, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Electronics: Powering electronic circuits and devices.</li>
    <li>Computers: Providing power to computer components.</li>
    <li>Telecommunications: Powering communication equipment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example Circuit</h2>
<p>Here is an example of a simple linear power supply circuit:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
Components:
- Transformer (120V to 12V)
- Bridge rectifier
- Capacitor (1000uF)
- Linear regulator (e.g., 7805)
- Load resistor (10 ohms)

Circuit:
1. Connect the primary winding of the transformer to the 120V AC power supply.
2. Connect the secondary winding of the transformer to the bridge rectifier.
3. Connect the output of the bridge rectifier to the capacitor.
4. Connect the output of the capacitor to the input of the linear regulator.
5. Connect the output of the linear regulator to the load resistor.

The output voltage is regulated by the linear regulator to provide a stable 5V DC.
