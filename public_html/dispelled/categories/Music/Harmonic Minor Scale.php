<h1>Harmonic Minor Scale</h1>
<p>The harmonic minor scale is a variation of the natural minor scale with a raised seventh degree. This raised seventh creates a leading tone that gives the scale a distinctive, exotic sound. It is widely used in classical, jazz, and metal music.</p>

<h2>Structure of the Harmonic Minor Scale</h2>
<p>The harmonic minor scale follows the pattern of whole steps (W) and half steps (H) as follows:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
W - H - W - W - H - W+H - H
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Example: A Harmonic Minor Scale</h2>
<p>The A harmonic minor scale consists of the following notes:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
A - B - C - D - E - F - G# - A
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Sound and Character</h2>
<p>The harmonic minor scale has an exotic and dramatic sound, characterized by the raised seventh degree. This raised seventh creates a strong pull towards the tonic, giving the scale a sense of tension and resolution. The harmonic minor scale is often used to create a sense of drama and intensity in music.</p>

<h2>Applications of the Harmonic Minor Scale</h2>
<p>The harmonic minor scale is used in various musical contexts, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Melody: Creating exotic and dramatic melodies.</li>
    <li>Harmony: Building minor chords with a raised seventh degree.</li>
    <li>Improvisation: Soloing over minor chord progressions with a raised seventh degree.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chords Derived from the Harmonic Minor Scale</h2>
<p>The harmonic minor scale can be used to derive the following chords:</p>

    <li>iv: Minor chord (e.g., Dm)</li>
    <li>V: Major chord (e.g., E)</li>
    <li>VI: Major chord (e.g., F)</li>
    <li>vii째: Diminished chord (e.g., G#째)</li>
</ul>
