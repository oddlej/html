<h1>Chord Progressions</h1>
<p>In music theory, a chord progression is a sequence of chords played in a specific order. Chord progressions are the foundation of harmony in music and are used to create the structure and movement of a piece.</p>

<h2>Common Chord Progressions</h2>
<p>There are several common chord progressions used in various genres of music. Here are a few examples:</p>

<h3>I-IV-V Progression</h3>
<p>The I-IV-V progression is one of the most common chord progressions in Western music. It consists of the first (I), fourth (IV), and fifth (V) chords of a major scale.</p>

</code>
</pre>

<h3>vi-IV-I-V Progression</h3>
<p>The vi-IV-I-V progression is often used in pop and rock music. It consists of the sixth (vi), fourth (IV), first (I), and fifth (V) chords of a major scale.</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
Example in C Major: Am - F - C - G
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Building Chord Progressions</h2>
<p>To build chord progressions, you can use the chords from a specific key. Here are the diatonic chords in the key of C major:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext">
I: C Major
ii: D Minor
iii: E Minor
IV: F Major
V: G Major
vi: A Minor
viiÂ°: B Diminished
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Applications of Chord Progressions</h2>
<p>Chord progressions are used in various aspects of music, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Composition: Creating the harmonic structure of a piece.</li>
    <li>Improvisation: Providing a framework for improvisation.</li>
    <li>Accompaniment: Supporting melodies and solos.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
<p>Here are some practice exercises to help you get familiar with chord progressions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Play the I-IV-V progression in the key of G major on your instrument.</li>
    <li>Write out the ii-V-I progression in the key of F major and play it on your instrument.</li>
    <li>Practice playing the vi-IV-I-V progression in the key of D major, focusing on smooth transitions between chords.</li>
</ol>
