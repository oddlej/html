<h1>Starting with Github - Create a new repository on the command line</h1>

<p>This is specifically for <a href="https://github.com">Github.com</a>. I have set up an SSH key and authenticated it, and now I want to start building repos. There is other ways to do this, but i'd rather do it locally on the command line.</p>


<pre>$ mkdir test 							# make a new directory in your main git folder
$ cd test							# change to that directory
$ gh repo create test --public					# create the repository folder on github
$ echo "# test repository" >> README.md				# make a line in a file called README.md that says # test repository 
$ git init 							# initialize the repository
$ git add . 							# or -A for all or README.md for one file
$ git commit -m "test commit"					# commit with the message test commit
$ git branch -M main						# specify the branch is main
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:oddlej/test.git		# this is showing how you are going to authenticate. It can be ssh as I have setup up or https
$ git push -u origin main					# push these changes to the server

</pre>

<p>That's it. You now have a synced version on Github.com. If you get any errors, you either have a directory under that name, or have configuration problems. If you have trouble on the push after the set remote line check <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14762034/push-to-github-without-a-password-using-ssh-key">here</a>. Once the remote is set you need to use set-url to change it. Also here is a <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add">few</a> <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes">links</a> to using the <a href="https://github.com/git-guides/git-add">add command</a>. Here is the complete sequence on my machine, and here's a <a href="https://github.com/oddlej/test">link</a> to it.</p>

<p> I then changed the README.md file on the Github app on my phone to test and committed it. Let's get it locally with a pull.</p>

<p>Once you have completed this sequence, you will use some of these commands to commit new changes to the folder. <a href="https://opentechschool.github.io/github-from-scratch/git/">This</a> is a great starting point as well. You can use master instead of main, I just like my main branch being called main. Git 'er done! :p</p>
